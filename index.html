            <aside class="notes">
                Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML, CSS, and either JavaScript or a
                language like Typescript that compiles to JavaScript.
                Typescript is more common in Angular community because Angular itself has been written with Typescript.

                    But as our applications get more complex vanilla JavaScript or jQuery becomes hard to maintain and

                So what are the benefits of using Angular?
                It gives our application a clear and loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand and easy to
                maintain.
                It also brings in a lot of utility code that we can reuse in various applications. Especially when
                dealing with the user’s navigation and the browser history.
                Plus, applications build with Angular are more testable so we can easy write automated test to test
                various part of our application.

                    So the first thing you need to install is the latest version of Node - runtime environment for
                    executing JavaScript code outside the browser.

                    application.
                    We have node modules and this is where you store all the third party libraries that our application

                    We have the source folder and this is where we have the actual source code of our application.
                    So we have this app folder here and inside this folder we have a module and a component.
                    We have these assets folder where you store the static assets of our application.
                    We have this environments folder and this is where we store configuration settings for different
                    environments.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Also in source folder we have index.html file which contains our Angular application.
                    So note here we don't have any references to a script or a stylesheet.
                    These references will be dynamically inserted into this page. I will show you this a bit later.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Also we have main file which is a typescript file and this is basically the starting point of our
                    application.
                    So all you're doing here is bootstrapping the main module of our application which is in this case
                    app module.
                    So angular loads this module and everything else starts from there.

                    So this polyfills file is a gap between the features of javascript that angular needs and the
                    features supported by the current browsers.
                    We have styles.css and this is where we add the global styles for our application and also each page
                    or each component can have its own styles.
                    We have test.ts which is basically used for setting up more testing environments

                    The other file here is TSconfig which has a bunch of settings for your typescript compiler. So your
                    typescript compiler looks at the settings and based on the settings is going to compile your
                    typescript code into javascript browsers can understand.
                    We have TSlint. Jason which includes a number of settings for TSlint.

                    Angular CLI uses a tool called webpack.
                    It gets all our scripts and stylesheets combines them with them in a bundle and then modifies that bundle. And this is for optimization.
                    Now that aside what I want to note here is that whenever you change one of your files that file being a stylesheet type of file or an HTML file, webpack automatically recompile your application and refreshes your bundles.

                And in the end I would like to give you a little bit of history.
                AngularJS  introduced in 2010 as a javascript framework for building client applications.
                It gained popularity and angular team decided to rewrite the original framework using typescript and as a result Anglar 2 came out in mid 2016.
                This new version is entirely different from Angular 1 to the extent that you can think of it as a completely different framework.
                After it was made some updates  Angular team decided to drop the version suffix and simply call the framework angular.
                So now we have two kinds of angular.
                We have Angular JS which is the first generation of Angler written in javascript and is going to die sooner or later.
                And we also have angular which refers to angular 2 or later.
